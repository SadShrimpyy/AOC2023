Advent Of Code 2023 in Java :)

## Run

To initiate the resolution of the problem, you just need to enter the corresponding folder for the day and compile the respective `.java` file.

The basic command is as follows: `java className.java <args>`

Certainly, in the arguments, certain parameters are required (such as the input file). However, the compiler will notify you if a parameter has not been provided!
